# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BrendaCantuL

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m curious about almost everything and always eager to learn something new  
ðŸŒ± Currently learning Python through Stanfordâ€™s Code In Place program  
ðŸ’¼ I studied Communications and work in Marketing, but Iâ€™ve been into tech since I was 8  
ðŸ’» I wrote my first programs in BASIC as a kid and have been hooked on solving problems ever since  
ðŸ“« You can find me at [brendacantul.net](https://www.brendacantul.net)  
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her  
âš¡ Fun fact: I thrive on a good challengeâ€”especially when it pushes me to learn and build in new ways
